            <h2>Why are bears so awesome? Well, just because.</h2>
            <p>
                Bears are keystone, or umbrella, species.  Each  population of bears is of great significance to the wider ecosystem in which it lives.  If steps are taken to protect a bear populationâ€™s habitat then the whole related environment and the animals and plants within it also benefit.

                At this point, I think we can all agree that bears are just the best. Here are some bear thoughts from:<a href="https://helloiamabear.com/" target="_blank" alt="Hello, I am a Bear">https://helloiamabear.com/</a>

            <h3>Bear Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Since I have no way to determine if I am good at being a bear, I really have no way to determine if I should have progressed in my bearness. I have never gotten any kind of clue or indication that I should be getting better at being a bear over some period of time. Should I be a better bear each day? Each year? Is my progress meant to be incremental or something that should be obvious and very easily noticeable?
                Or, maybe, I am not supposed to become a better bear. There is a chance that my bearness is not meant to grow. Maybe I am a bear, and I am supposed to be just the bear I am. Not a better one. Not a worse one. Just one, single bear that I already am until I am not a bear anymore.
